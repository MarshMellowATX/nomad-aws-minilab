# Nomad AWS Mini Lab

Small-scale HashiCorp Nomad running across AWS EC2 instances for quick testing and tear down.

## What's In Here?

The Nomad AWS Mini Lab is comprised of:

* AWS VPC
* Security Groups for ingress and egress
* 3 public subnets
* 3 EC2 instances by default spread across 3 availability zones


## What's Missing?

This is work in progress. More is being done to add dynamic  deployment scripts/processes for both Nomad and Consul which will help this be much more self-starting.
